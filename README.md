# AQ-Dublin-COVID
Repository that holds data/R Code for a research project analyzing air quality changes in Dublin, IE during the COVID-19 lockdown.
When replicating these analyses, you will need to change the working directory in the beginning of each markdown file to match the location where you have placed the downloaded .csv files on YOUR machine. For example, if you download the .csv files for PM analysis to your 'Downloads' folder, you will have to set that as the path in the 'setwd()' function at the top of each markdown file.
